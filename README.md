# C4-lang
 C# Syntax in C++
 
# WIP, unusable atm.

# Installation
Step 1) Install golang. Really easy installation, cross platform.

Step 2) Clone the C4-lang repo. Can be as simple as downloading and extracting the zip.

Step 3) Open the root folder with a command processor. The same folder containing this README file.

Step 4) Enter the command: go run .

Step 5) C4 should now be installed. You can use the command C4 anywhere where you can use the go command.

Step 6) Check if it's installed by running C4 test, as instructed by the installer.

# Docs
C4 help shows the available commands for the C4 compiler. You can also just type C4 with no arguments.

To build and run a file quickly: C4 run \<filename\>

To just build a file to be ran later: C4 build <filename>


# Uninstall
C4 attaches itself to golang to ensure simple cross platform use.

This means to uninstall C4, you must uninstall golang.

Currently golang doesn't always fully uninstall itself, so after you uninstall golang, 

You must find and delete the installation folder containing the go command. 

This is located in the path variable if that helps.

Then, when you reinstall golang if you still want to use go, you won't have C4 anymore.

So, if this language causes issues or you don't want it anymore, you can do this.

But, if you want to help make C4 better, please submit an issue here.

I'm always looking to improve.
